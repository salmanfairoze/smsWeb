The word "animal" comes from the Latin
[animalis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/animalis#Latin "wikt:animalis"),
meaning having breath, having soul or living being.[1] The biological
definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia.[2] In colloquial
usage, as a consequence of [anthropocentrism](/wiki/Anthropocentrism
"Anthropocentrism"), the term animal is sometimes used nonscientifically to
refer only to non-human animals.[3][4][5][6]
