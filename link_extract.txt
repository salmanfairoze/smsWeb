Edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially
available [fluoroscope](/wiki/Fluoroscopy "Fluoroscopy"), a machine that uses
[X-rays](/wiki/X-rays "X-rays") to take [radiographs](/wiki/Radiographs
"Radiographs"). Until Edison discovered that [calcium
tungstate](/wiki/Scheelite "Scheelite") fluoroscopy screens produced brighter
images than the barium [platinocyanide](/wiki/Platinocyanide "Platinocyanide")
screens originally used by [Wilhelm Röntgen](/wiki/Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen
"Wilhelm Röntgen"), the technology was capable of producing only very faint
images.

The fundamental design of Edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although
Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and
seriously injuring his assistant, [Clarence
Dally](/wiki/Clarence_Madison_Dally "Clarence Madison Dally"). Dally made
himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was
exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation; he later died (at the age of 39) of
injuries related to the exposure, mediastinal cancer.[87]

In 1903, a shaken Edison said: "Don't talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of
them."[88] Nonetheless, his work was important in the development of a
technology still used today.[89]
