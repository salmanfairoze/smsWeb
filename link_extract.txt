All the courses which have been conferred autonomous status have their
departments set their own course content and grading system. The college
follows the [credit-based system](/wiki/Course_credit "Course credit") of
performance evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their
importance. The total marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of grades,
with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks. For each
semester, the students are graded by taking a weighted average of all the
subject grades with their respective credit points. Each semester's evaluation
is done independently with a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) reflecting
the overall performance across semesters. Till June 2012, the grading system
being followed was [relative grading](/wiki/Grading_on_a_curve "Grading on a
curve"),[10] but the college switched to an absolute grading system after
consultations with the university.[11]
